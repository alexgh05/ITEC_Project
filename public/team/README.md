# Team Member Photos

To display your photos on the About page, please add the following files to this directory:

1. `team-member-1.jpg` - Ghilezan Madalin's photo (Co-Founder & Technical Lead)
2. `team-member-2.jpg` - Ghenciu Alexandru's photo (Co-Founder & Creative Director)

Guidelines for best results:
- Use square or close to square aspect ratio photos
- Minimum recommended size: 500x500 pixels
- Both photos should be of similar size and style for visual consistency
- The photos will be displayed in circular frames, so center the faces

The names and roles have been updated in the About page in `src/pages/About.tsx`.
